# **Parffin Wax Odor detection using HS-GC/MS data combined with ML**

The **machine-learning_HSGCMS_ParaffinWax_Odor** repository contains data processing approaches and machine learning techniques applied to discriminate and quantify the odor of paraffin wax samples. The study focuses on the classification of paraffin wax based on hydroprocessing levels, which significantly affect their olfactory characteristics.

## üîç Objective

The main goal of this project is to classify paraffin wax samples into five categories based on the degree of hydroprocessing:

- **None**: Non-hydrotreated paraffin.
- **Low**: 75% hydrotreated + 25% non-hydrotreated paraffin.
- **Moderate**: 50% hydrotreated + 50% non-hydrotreated paraffin.
- **High**: 25% hydrotreated + 75% non-hydrotreated paraffin.
- **Full**: Fully hydrotreated paraffin.

## üõ†Ô∏è **System Requirements**

### Software
- **R version 4.2.0** 
- RStudio (optional but recommended)

1. **Hierarchical Clustering Analysis (HCA)**:
   - Performed using the `hclust` function from the **stats** package (version 4.1.2).
   - The agglomerative coefficient was calculated using the `agnes` function from the **cluster** package (version 2.1.3).
   - Results were visualized with the `fviz_dend` function from the **factoextra** package (version 1.0.7).

2. **Supervised Learning Models**:
   - Developed using the `trainControl` and `train` functions from the **caret** package (version 6.0-93).
   - Regression metrics were calculated using the **MLmetrics** package (version 1.1.1).
   - Important variables for PLS and RF models were extracted with the `varImp` function from the **caret** package.

3. **Data Visualization**:
   - Plots generated using **ggplot2** (version 3.3.6) and **graphics** (version 4.1.2).

4. **Interactive Web Application**:
   - Developed with the **shiny** package (version 1.7.2).
